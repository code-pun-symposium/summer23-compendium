Archive the cold code puns that no one asks for, but keep the nerds happy.

> How can dogs code in Python? Possibly byte them?

Unlike other data science nerds, I love metal music and fashion, which are the best ways to express myself. 

My favorite metal band is “vektor”, and fashion brands are “the row” and “theory”.

(btw highly recommend [Vektor](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Vektor/87803) the prog thrash metal band!
